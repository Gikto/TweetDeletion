# TweetDeletion

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/tweet_deletion`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tweet_deletion'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tweet_deletion

## Usage

```ruby
TwitterDeletion.with(
  consumer_key: "…",
  consumer_secret: "…",
  access_token: "…",
  access_token_secret: "…",
) do 

  for_favorites do
    keep_if by(:me) 
    keep_if earlier_than( 10.days.ago )
    keep_if rt_by(:me)
  end 

  for_tweets do
    keep_if earlier_than( 10.days.ago )
    delete_if rt_of(:me) if is_rt
    keep_if fav_by(:me)
    keep_if has_kept_reply
    keep_if has_kept_quote
    unless is_rt
      keep_if rt_by_more_than( 50 )
      keep_if fav_by_more_than( 50 )
    end
  end

end



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
